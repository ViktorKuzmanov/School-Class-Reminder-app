# School-Class-Reminder

My first IOS app I made in High School. 

It was a big challege to start off my career path, but somehow I pushed it through.
Loved the journey. Every second of it.

Lots of spaghetti code in here, but hey it was just my first app.

And you know the funniest part ? I sold it !

Not to Google sadly.

Looking forward to the next one.
